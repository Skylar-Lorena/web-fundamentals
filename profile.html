        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I live Kenya, and I'm currently working at<a href="moringaschool.com"> Moringa School,</a> striving to connect our African people to the
                future they envision for themselves</li>
            <li>I was born in Kenya, though I am Tanzanian by blood.</li>
            <li>Fun fact: I Sing, Rap and Paint and I'm a Part-Time Rock Show Radio Host</a>.</li>
            <li>I'm always working on something, and often too excited to work with other creatives.</li>
